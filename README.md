# quizzler_project

## The Main Goal

In this project, we're going to review Stateless and Stateful Widget. Moreover, we will learn about the main building blocks in OOP: Classes and Objects.

## The App

The app simulates a quiz game which will test our general knowledge. Users can have fun by playing this game when bored or maybe when they need to wait for a flight.

## Learning Topics

* Modularising our code into separate classes.
* Use Dart Classes and Objects.
* Use Classes Constructor.
* Extract Widget and refactor our code.
* Understand and use private and public modifiers in Dart.
* Dart Lists.
* Differences between var, const, and final.
